# Main Objective and Overview

The main goal of our Parking Management System - EasyPark, is to solve the problems that vehicles have when parking on University of East Anglia’s (UEA) campus, including traffic congestion, limited parking spaces, and time-consuming parking searches.

EasyPark helps solve these issues by navigating drivers to available places and by improving parking allocation. This saves time wasted looking for free parking spots and significantly reduces car emissions. Besides convenience, it also advances UEA’s environmental objective to be 80% of the way to net zero by 2030. The system is heavily user oriented, providing user-friendly experience to both drivers and admins. EasyPark offers extensive tooling for admins to manage user accounts, observe parking availability, and communicate with drivers. Drivers, on the other hand, benefit from a separate User Interface that provides functionality like registration, parking requests, payments, and automatic location assignments. Our app was created with scalability in mind, so it can adapt to the changes in UEA by allowing admins to add parking lots as the parking infrastructure increases.

With the help of EasyPark, we aim to significantly reduce the amount of time drivers spend looking for parking spaces by at least 70% making it more efficient.
