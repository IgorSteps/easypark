## Running locally

### Prerequisites

- Linux environment
- VS Code
- Docker
- Golang (LTS version)

### Setting up environment

From project root, run:

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to create required PostgreSQL image and optional PgAdmin image for DB user interface.

### Starting the app

From project root, run:

1. Build the app, run `make build`.
2. To run the app, run `make run`.

If changes to dependecy graph have been made, you must edit `wire.go` file and run `make wire` to regenerate dependecy injection code(`wire_gen.go` file).

### Troubleshooting

Will be edited once problems appear.

## Testing

To regenerate mocks for unit tests, run `make mocks`.

To run unit tests, run `make unit`.

To run functional tests, run `make functional`.

## Useful things

### Cleaning database tables

Run `make clean-db` to truncate existing tables. Note, you need to add new table names to `./build/clean-bd.sh` script.

### Creating admin user

Run the `createadmin.sh` script, to create a user with admin role in the database.

To get JWT for this admin, run:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "Username": "adminUsername",
    "Password": "securePassword"
}'
```

For example, as an admin, you can curl `drivers` endpoint to get all drivers:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN_FROM_ABOVE> http://localhost:8080/drivers
```

### Connecting to PgAdmin

PgAdming provides a nice UI for DB management and debugging.

1. Go to `http://localhost:5050` to access PgAdmin
2. Log in with the `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL` and `PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` in the docker-compose.yml file
3. To connect to our PostgreSQL database from PgAdmin:
    - Right-click on "Servers" in the left panel and choose "Create > Server".
    - In the "Create Server" dialog, go to the "Connection" tab.
    - Set "Hostname/address" to `database`, which is the name of our PostgreSQL service defined in our docker-compose.yml.
    - Fill in the "Username" and "Password" fields with the POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_PASSWORD specified in docker-compose.yml.
    - Click "Save" to establish the connection.
